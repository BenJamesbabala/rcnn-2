### Modeling Ingredients from Wikipedia text

This repo contains the code to generate representations for ingredients and adulterants based on the Wikipedia articles. The representations are used to predict a food product category from a given ingredient. We also show a sequential update model that can improve predictions based on a few observations.

The RNN model is based off of https://github.com/taolei87/rcnn.

The code also requires access to the following repository: https://github.com/youyanggu/adulteration.
